To complete this challenge, we need to decrypt using various encryptions:

1. First of all we need to decrypt the morse code, which give us
```plain
GREAT  YOU VE CLEARED THE FIRST STEP  I HAD TO ENCRYPT THE MESSAGE TO PREVENT IT FROM BEING INTERCEPTED  CONTINUE TO DECRYPT
```
2. Then we need to decrypt the second line of the file. We can using a online tool to figure out witch encryption it has and is base64, so we decrypt it and we get:

```plain

We see that there are 3 differents type of encryption:
1. The first one is a substitution cipher, so we have to brute force trying to change letters by letters the text. After do that we get

```plain
SOMETHING WEIRD IS GOING ON AT THE LIBRARY. 
I MANAGED TO HACK INTO A RUSSIAN FORM I FOUND ON THE LIBRARY'S WEBSITE. 
I THINK THEY'RE USING THE LIBRARY AS A COVER FOR MORE MINDFLAYER RESEARCH. 
Iâ€™M GONNA GIVE YOU THE COORDINATES OF THE SECRET MASSAGE, TELL MIKE TO COME HERE!

```

2. The second seems to be coordinates. But if we look carefully, we may notice a pattern where there are "number-number-munber". This could be a "numbers to letters cipher", where every number leads to its position in the alphabet:

3. This one is optional (since we've  already found the flag), but who cares. It seems a hex encryption so

```plain

```

we clearly notice that the text is revesed so 
```plain
Congratulations! If you've made it this far, you deserve an endless song performed by me and my lovely Suzie! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZYAjwxel9A (paste the link and get comfortable)
```

That was worth it!
