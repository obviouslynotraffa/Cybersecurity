### ðŸ“„ Description

Unluckly, the message is encrypted but we know the sender is
the eXORcist!

Can you understand what he wants?

    </summary>

Since the key is 2 chars long, we can try a bruteforce approach.
The solution provided reads the encrypted message from a file, then iterates through all possible combinations of keys within the specified length range, attempting to decrypt the message. If a decrypted message containing the string `spritz{` is found, it prints the message and the key used to decrypt it.
