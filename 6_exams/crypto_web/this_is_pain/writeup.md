# ðŸ”‘ Write-Up

1. After read the ciphertext file, we can notice that it consists of `Z` and `O`.
2. Replace the Z => 0 and O => 1.
3. The result is in binary code, so we can convert it into characters.
4. It's encoded in base64, so we proceed with the decoding.
5. It's a substitution cipher text file, so we need to create a dictionary to replace the old characters with the new ones.
