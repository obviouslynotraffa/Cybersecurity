# ðŸ”‘ Write-Up

There's a function that checks if the user has cheated using a `ptrace()` check, it can be easily patched by `NOP` the call of `stack trace`.

We see that to decide whether to generate the step L or R, it takes a random number generated by the `rand()` function and checks if it is even (% 2). What we can do is that instead of calling the rand() function, it calls a register, where the value 0 is stored. In this way, every step will always be the same: Left.

You'd better check `patch.diff` file.
