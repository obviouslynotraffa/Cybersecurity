# Easy Bof

### ðŸ“„ Description
This time, you cannot patch the binary and you 
need to exploit a vulnerability in the code.

Additionally, we do not provide the code but you can know that:
```c
char buff[16];
```

Try to use gdb and understand the behavior of the program.

Also here, flag in clear but please report every step in the write-up!
