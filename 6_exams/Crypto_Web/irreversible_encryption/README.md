# Irreversible Encryption

### ðŸ“„ Description
I found a way to encrypt a message that is so efficient that from a short text creates a huuuuuuuuge file.

Finally I can communicate with my FRIENDO without
problems!
Can you find a way to reverse the operation?

We just need to invert the operations used to encrypt the key. We can use the same functions, but call them in inverse order

```python
decoded = binascii.unhexlify(hex_encrypted)
decoded = decoded.decode('ascii')

decoded = XORencode(decoded) 

for _ in range(15):
    decoded = ROTencode(decoded,-3)
    decoded = base32encode(decoded)
    decoded = ROTencode(decoded, -13)
    decoded = base64encode(decoded)
```
