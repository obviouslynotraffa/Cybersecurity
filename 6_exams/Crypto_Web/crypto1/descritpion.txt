This time you intercepted a communication between Professor Conti and his
teaching assistants. But this is encrypted!

Luckily, we know that their common encryption mechanisms is:

1. from plain message to Base64
2. Transform the Base64 with a Rotation Cipher of 13 positions

In order to read it, you need to perform the encrypting operation in reverse.

Good luck!
