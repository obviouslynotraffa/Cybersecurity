While loosing some time on the Internet you fell on a old blog-post about
conspiracy theories...

A self proclaimed hacker attached a network capture in a comment of this post
telling that he will be `0xdeadbeef` before finishing the work.

Even if the job seems risky you can't help it, you wanna look at it...
the adventure begins...
