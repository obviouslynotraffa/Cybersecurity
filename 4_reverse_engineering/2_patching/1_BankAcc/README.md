# Description
A code is sent to your OTP device to login in your bank account. Hope you didn't lose it!

## Solution
Using ida64, we notice that is asked a pin of 4 digits, but the pin is generated by a `random()` function.
What we can do is change the `op code` of the jump: `jnz` => `jz`. In this way every "wrong" pin takes us to the correct section of code, where we can see the flag.

## Flag
```plain
Flag{P00r_45_DuCk}
```
