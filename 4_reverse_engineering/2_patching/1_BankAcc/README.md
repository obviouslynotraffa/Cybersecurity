Using ida64, we notice that is asked a pin of 4 digits, but the pin is generated by a `random()` function.
What we can do is change the `op code` of the jump: `JNZ` => `JZ`. In this way every "wrong" pin takes us to the correct section of code, where we can see the flag.

If you take a look at `patch.diff`, you can notice that the `op code` of `JNZ`, which is `75`, has been changed into `74`, which is `JZ`.
