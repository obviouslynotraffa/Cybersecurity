# Hello world
### ðŸ“„ Description
Can you retrieve the flag?

## ðŸ”‘ Solution
The program asks the right pin. This can be obtain either using `strings hello_world` which extracts human readable strings from executables or using `ida64` which allows us to see that there's a compare statement between the input strings and `Fl4g`. Only if the 2 strings are equal, the console prints the flag.

### ðŸš© Flag
```plain
Flag{reverse_hello_world}
```
