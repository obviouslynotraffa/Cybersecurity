# Solution

We can analize the code. We see that if we put some breakpoints on the check of the username we can get something: 

<p align="center">"c5644ca91d1307779ed493c4dedfdcb7" </p>

We see that is coded from md5, so we can use an online tool for decode it.

If we do the same thing for the pass we'll have the flag:

## Flag
```plain
flag{sd90J0dnLKJ1ls9HJed}
```
