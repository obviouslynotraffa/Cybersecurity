## ðŸ”‘ Solution
* `+` in php isn't string concatenation, it's just addition
* addition between two strings coerces the operands to ints
* equality between an int and a string coerces the string to an int
* first check will pass as long as:
  * `pass` is either a letter or 0
  * request user agent is the same as `pass`
* second check will pass only if the first character of `pass` is the same as the first character of `pass` concatenated with the flag.
* there are only 7 possible characters, it's trivial to bruteforce (see `solution.py`)
