### ğŸ“„ Description
Can you retrieve the flag?

## ğŸ”‘ Solution

Analize the code: we see there's some usefull comment given by mistake by the developer

 <p align="center"> "Development test account: user JohnTestUser, pass: AtestAccount" </p>

 We try to put the info on the box and try to log and we will redirect to another page.

 Seems ther's another level, we can go:
 
  Ispection >>  Application and we change from 'user' to 'admin' and the flag will appear


### ğŸš© Flag
```plain
flag{C00kies_can_be_chenged?}
```
