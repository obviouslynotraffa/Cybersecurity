Our goal is to capture the flag, which is given
on line 12, inside the function print_flag.

Since in the 'main' execution flow there is no call to
that specific function, we need to manipulate the main's execution.

What are the weak points of this program?
You need to focus on line 17 (msg array definition)
and line 21 (user-application interaction).
