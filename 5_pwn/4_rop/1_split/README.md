# Split

### 📄 Description
I'll let you in on a secret; a useful string `/bin/cat flag.txt` is present in this binary, as is a call to `system()`. It's just a case of finding them and chaining them together to make the magic happen.

### ⚙ How to run it
```bash
./split
```

### ⛔ Rules
Don't open the `flag.txt` file.
